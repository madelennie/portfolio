          <h4>A Photographer that fell for tech</h4>
        I grew up with one of the first home computers from Apple. My family were introduced into the amazing world of internet and graphics through my elder sister who studied communcation and media. I had my own little hobby as an analogue photographer
        and developed my own sense for making creative pictures. Along with the photography I learned how to master the Apple machines, from early Macintosh Performa to the slim and exciting Macbooks. What was beneath the outer shell was as exciting as the software. I made my own custom made computers with the memory, RAM and graphic card I desired. The photography took a bigger leap and I ended up starting my own studio in 2016. I mostly take photography-sessions in black and white, portrait and documentary. Through the years I developed my own blogs, and created illustrations and photographic art with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. These are my biggest hobbies, next to diving into code and de-bugging. If you not catch me at home deep in a creating mood, you'll definitly find me on my longboard, cruising around somewhere. As from 2018 I am now studying Web development to continue one of the main interest in my life. Code and photography has a lot in comment - you can create something out of nothing and then develop it to something amazing.</p>
